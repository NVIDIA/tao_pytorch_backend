    To use this decorator, the loss function must have the signature like
    `loss_func(pred, target, **kwargs)`. The function only needs to compute
    element-wise loss without any reduction. This decorator will add weight
    and reduction arguments to the function. The decorated function will have
    the signature like `loss_func(pred, target, weight=None, reduction='mean',
    avg_factor=None, **kwargs)`.

    >>> import torch
    >>> @weighted_loss
    >>> def l1_loss(pred, target):
    >>>     return (pred - target).abs()

    >>> pred = torch.Tensor([0, 2, 3])
    >>> target = torch.Tensor([1, 1, 1])
