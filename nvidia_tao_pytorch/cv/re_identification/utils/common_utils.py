    Plot evaluation results from queries.

    This method will plot a Mx(N+1) grid for images from query & gallery folders.
    Query images will be randomly sampled from their folder. The closest matching
    N gallery images will be plotted besides the query images.

    M = num_queries
    N = max_rank

    The image in the first column comes from the query image folder.
    The image in the rest of the columns will come from the nearest
    matches from the gallery folder.

    A blue border is drawn over the images in the first column.

    A green border over an image indicates a true positive match.
    A red border over an image indicates a false positive match.

    This plot is saved using matplotlib at output_file location.

    Args:
        num_queries (int): Number of queries to plot.
        query_maps (list(list)): List of query images mapped with test images with their corresponding match status.
        max_rank (int): Max rank to plot.
        output_file (str): Output file to plot.

    Forward:
        Plots a grid of images showcasing the matches found for each query image.
        The grid will have a width of max_rank + 1 and a height of num_queries.
        Images are color-coded based on their match status. The plot is then saved to the specified output file.
