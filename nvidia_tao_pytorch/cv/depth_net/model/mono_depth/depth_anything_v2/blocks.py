    layers for the DPT head. These layers process multi-scale feature maps
    from the backbone network and prepare them for depth prediction.

    Args:
        in_shape (list): List of input channel dimensions for each scale level.
            Length indicates the number of scales (typically 3 or 4).
        out_shape (int): Base number of output channels for each layer.
        groups (int, optional): Number of groups for grouped convolutions.
            Defaults to 1 (standard convolution).
        expand (bool, optional): Whether to use expanding channel dimensions
            across scales. If True, later scales get more channels.
            Defaults to False.
