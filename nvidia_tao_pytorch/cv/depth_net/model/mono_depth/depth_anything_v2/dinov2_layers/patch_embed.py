    This module converts 2D images into a sequence of patch embeddings, which is
    the first step in Vision Transformer architectures. It divides the input image
    into non-overlapping patches and projects each patch to a high-dimensional
    embedding space.

    The module performs the transformation: (B, C, H, W) -> (B, N, D) where:
    - B is batch size
    - C is number of input channels
    - H, W are image height and width
    - N is number of patches (H//patch_size * W//patch_size)
    - D is embedding dimension

    Attributes:
        img_size (tuple): Input image size (height, width).
        patch_size (tuple): Patch size (height, width).
        patches_resolution (tuple): Number of patches in each dimension.
        num_patches (int): Total number of patches.
        in_chans (int): Number of input channels.
        embed_dim (int): Embedding dimension.
        flatten_embedding (bool): Whether to flatten the embedding.
        proj (nn.Conv2d): Convolutional projection layer.
        norm (nn.Module): Normalization layer.
